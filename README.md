## UNDERSTANDING THE DATA

The data came from different  movie sites .
The data contained various information such as the movie name, studio , runtime in minutes, the average rating , 
cost of production , both domestic gross,the year of production  and foreign gross and genre of the movie.  
Since the data was from different sites it had different number of rows and columns.

 ## DATA CLEANINIG AND WRANGLING
  The data had some missing values which were to either be dropped or
  replaced appropriately after evaluating which method of replacement that will not majorly affect the data.
 The data had different data types, some data types did not had to be transformed
 from one type to another for instance in the budget data set the production cost was in recorded as 
 a string and we needed the data as either an integer or a float.
  ## EXPLORITORY DATA ANALYSIS
   Different visualization are made to the-the behaviour and the character
   of different data type. This is where outliers were detected using the box plot method and made the necessary decision
   weather to drop the outlier or keep them depending on the column and how it will affect the end result. Scatter plot to 
   observe the relationship between various column, and bar plot to understand the count of different categorical data.
  
##  DATA ANALYSIS
 Data analysis was performed to get the statistical over view of the data by getting the
 summary statistics and how the data deviated from the mean using the standard deviation. 
 Getting the kind and the strength of relationship 
 of different data type to get to understand how one variable change would get to tell the other variable change.
